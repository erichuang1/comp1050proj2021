Code Section 1 - Data Loading
Question 1
What is the meaning of each column in the output from executing code block 1.2?
There're a total of 4 sensor group locations: Wrist, Chest, Hip and Ankle. 
Each sensor group has got 2 types of sensors: Accelerometer and Gyroscope. 
The Accelerometer measuring linear acceleration is in 3 axes and the Gyroscope measuring angular rotation is also in 3 axes.
The last number (25th) states what activity the data is related to.

Code Section 2- Signal Processing
Question 1
What are the output from executing code block 2.2? (Hint: think of the activity, the sensor and number of sensor 
records used)?
It's plotting the Accelerometer readouts from record 500 to 1500 wherever the record is tagged as Activity 1 (Sitting).
