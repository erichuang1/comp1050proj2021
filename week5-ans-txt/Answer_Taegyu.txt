Section 3

#Question 1
#
#What are the output from executing code block 3.1? (Hint: think of the activity and the sensor)
#
#For x, y and z axis data of the accelerometer, a min and max value is extracted. 
#So the first six numbers are features and the last number is the activity label.



#Question 2
#
#After executing code block 3.3, there is a definition of window, what exactly is the window? (Hint: think from 
#feature engineering perspective, shall we retrieve one specific numeric feature, for instance max for the X axle 
#of the first gyroscope sensor in the dataset used for the HAR project? why yes? why not?)
#
#From code block 1.4 we can see the number of samples of activity and windows from code block 3.3 seem to be an the number of samples/1000.
#And for each window there are 1000 rows of activity. So, a window is a way of grouping large samples(?).


#Question 3
#
#After executing code block 3.3, what patterns you can see from the output difference/similarity between dataset_1 
#and dataset_3? (Hint: think from the number of windows for each activity)
#
#The number of windows or samples are similar for all activities between dataset_1 and dataset_3.
#Activity 7 has the most windows and activity 8 and 9 has the least windows.
