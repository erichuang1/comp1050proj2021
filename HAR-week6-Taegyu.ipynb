    "For time series data, we should convert the raw dataset to feature dataset, where each data sample contains features extracted from a period of time. For example, for each 1000 sensor data records/rows,we can consider it as a segmentation (Window) and extract statistic features from it. In this tutorial, we extract minï¼Œ max and mean values of the first acceleromter on the wrist sensor. In data visualization used in the previous weeks, we could find that for different activities the sensor signal data values are in different ranges. Therefore, we could think that we could recognize different activities by the range of data, which means minimum,maximum and mean values of data may be useful features to recognize activities.     "
