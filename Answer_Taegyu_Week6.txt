#Challenge 1

#Question 1
#
#After executing code block 1.1, do you notice there are two new files generated in your local folder?
#what are the difference between these two files? (Hint: think from the lecture, what is the difference between 
#model training and model inference?)
#
#A trainig_data1 file and a testing_data1 file was created.
#A training data is the initial dataset you use to teach a model or recognise patterns or perform to a criteria.
#A testing data is a dataset to validate the model.

#Question 2
#
#After executing code block 1.1, you see an accuracy value (Accuracyï¼šx) in the output? How was it calculated? 
#
#The accuracy was 0.4225941422594142.

#Question 3
#
#After executing code block 1.1, there is an matrix output. Why it takes a while to output? What are the columns 
#and what are the rows?  
#
#It takes a while as there are large amount of data being compared.
#The columns are predictions for a specific activity, so the first column is the prediction for activity 1, second colmn is predictio for activity 2, etc.
#The rows are the actual number of the activity, so the first row is the number of activity 1, second row is number of activity 2, etc.
#Value in columns that aren't on the diagonal are false positives. 
#Value in rows that aren't on the diagonal are true negatives.



#Challenge 2

#Question 3
#
#A potential reason for the bad accuracy might be because there aren't enough training data (for activity 9).
#And some activities are hard to distinguish with one another (like acitivity 11 and 12).
#Increasing the number of training_dataset will 'train' the model more hence making it more accurate.
#And adjusting the k-value in k-NN algorithm will improve the accuracy.
