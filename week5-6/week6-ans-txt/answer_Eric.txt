Challenge 3

Question 1

After running code block 2.1 where we change K value of the KNN model from 3 to 4 , compared to the results from running 
code block 1.1, which actitivies have improved 
accuracy and which activities has decreased accuracy?  How about the overall accuracy (improved or dropped)? 

Improved: 
Standing              1-5
Washing dishes        16-20
Walking outside       0-34
Descending stairs     3-6
Bicycling (50 watt)   18-19

Decreased: 
Sweeping              7-5

Overall accuracy is improved from 42.3% to 60.7%


Question 2

After running code block 2.2 where we further increase the value of model K value to 6 from 4, compared to the results from running 
code block 2.1, does such change help in improving the accuracy? If so, which activities has improved accuracy? 
How about the overal accuracy (improved or dropped)?

It does not help much on improving the accuracy. In fact it decreased the accuracy by a little, from 60.7% to 59.4%. 

Improved: 
Activity Name       Changes True    False   Accuracy
Standing            +2      7       5       53.8%
Descending stairs   +1      7       0       100%
Bicycling (50 watt) +1      20      4       83.3%

Decreased:      
Activity Name       Changes True    False   Accuracy
Washing dishes      -1      19      5       79.2%
Vacuuming           -1      9       3       75%
Sweeping            -1      4       11      26.7%
Walking outside     -4      30      25      36.4%


Question 3

After running code block 2.3 where we used 2 participants data to train the main instead of using 1, compared to the results from running 
code block 2.1, which actitivies have improved 
accuracy and which activities has decreased accuracy?  How about the overall accuracy (improved or dropped)?

Improved: 
Standing                        7-9
Washing dishes                  19-20
Walking outside                 30-45
Ascending stairs                0-3
Bicycling (100 watt)            1-9

Decreased: 
Vacuuming                       9-1
Sweeping                        4-3
Descending stairs               7-2
Treadmill running (8.3 km/h)    24-16
Bicycling (50 watt)             20-2
Rope jumping                    9-7

The overall accuracy has dropped from 60.7% to 53.1%, probably because different people have different habits or behaviours. 


Question 4

After running code block 2.4 where we used 4 participants data to train the model, compared to the results from running 
code block 2.3, which actitivies have improved 
accuracy and which activities has decreased accuracy?  How about the overall accuracy (improved or dropped)?


Improved: 
Sitting                 0-7
Vacuuming               1-9
Bicycling (50 watt)     2-23
Rope jumping            7-13

Decreased: 
Lying                   12-11
Standing                9-3
Washing dishes          20-19
Walking outside         45-21
Bicycling (100 watt)    9-1

Overall accuracy is improved from 53.1% to 63.1% as the data is getting generalized
