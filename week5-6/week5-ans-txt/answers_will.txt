1.2: 
In a set of data, for each activity there is x amount of rows assigned to it.

In terms of the meaning of the data, the dataset_number is the number of the subject, the samples are the 
records in which the data from the sensor files is stored, and the activity number is the label for each 
record noting which activity they were doing. 

2.2: 
Each output is an activity with sensor records 500 to 1500 graphed, but this time the noise (spread) 
of each line is significantly reduced, allowing for the data to be more easily read.

2.3:
The outputs are a graph with activity 10's gyroscope data plotted with sensor data from records 
500-1500, and another graph but with reduced spread/noise.
